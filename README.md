# Quiz Step-by-Step

## Step 1 Completed

Your first task was to create a Question component which will display one question and its answers, along with a Next button. In this branch, this has been done for you. As requested:

* The answers are shown in the same order as they are given in the `questions.json` file
* Clicking on the Next button cycles through the questions in order.

## Step 2: Provide visual feedback when an answer is selected

Your second task is to create an Answers component, where each answer is displayed as a radio button, so only one answer can be selected at a time.

* Create an Answers component
* Send the `answers` data for the current question as `props` to the Answers component
* Display each question as the label for a radio buttons
* Preset these elements in list items in an unordered list
* Use CSS to hide the radio button itself
* Use CSS to make the selected answer change its look when pressed
